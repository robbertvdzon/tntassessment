# I'have choosen the following environment:
- java11 (the current latest LTS version)
- maven
- junit5
- Javalin for handling the rest call's
- Lombok for creating less verbose pojo's
- Pact for consumer driven contract tests
- AssertJ for using during unit tests
- Typesafe Config for loading configuration settings
